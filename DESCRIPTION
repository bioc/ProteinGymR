Description: The ProteinGymR package provides analysis-ready data resources from 
    ProteinGym, generated by Notin et al., 2023. ProteinGym comprises a 
    collection of benchmarks for evaluating the performance of models 
    predicting the effect of point mutations. This package provides access to 
    1. Deep mutational scanning (DMS) scores from 217 assays measuring the 
    impact of all possible amino acid substitutions across 186 proteins, 2. 
    AlphaMissense pathogenicity scores for ~1.6 M substitutions in the 
    ProteinGym DMS data, and 3. five performance metrics for 62 variant 
    prediction models in a zero-shot setting.
