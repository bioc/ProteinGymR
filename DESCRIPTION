Description: The ProteinGymR package provides analysis-ready data
    resources related to ProteinGym, a database of benchmarks and deep 
    mutational scanning assays (DMS) curated and processed by Notin et al. 2023. 
    This package provides programmatic access of ProteinGym resources through 
    ExperimentHub. Currently, this package contains 1. Deep mutational 
    scanning (DMS) scores generated from single substitution mutations across 
    216 assays and 2. predicted AlphaMissense pathogenicity scores for ~1.6M 
    substitutions matching those in the ProteinGym DMS data.
