# ProteinGymR 0.99.0
- Added the following datasets to ExperimentHub:
    1. DMS substitution scores for 217 assays
    2. AlphaMissense pathogenicity scores for ProteinGym mutations
    3. Zero-shot model performance metrics for DMS substitutions across 62 
    models
    4. Reference file with metadata for 217 DMS assays
- `benchmark_models()` for plotting performance scores across 5 models
- `dms_corr_plot()` for correlating AlphaMissense scores and DMS assay scores
