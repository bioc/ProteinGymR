# ProteinGymR

## Data resources from ProteinGym

The `ProteinGymR` package provides analysis-ready data resources from 
[ProteinGym](https://proteingym.org), generated by [Notin et al., 
2023](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10723403/). ProteinGym 
comprises a collection of benchmarks for evaluating the performance of models 
predicting the effect of point mutations. This package provides access to two 
datasets: 1. Deep mutational scanning (DMS) scores from 216 assays measuring the 
impact of all possible amino acid substitutions across 186 proteins, and 2. 
AlphaMissense pathogenicity scores for ~1.6 M substitutions in the ProteinGym 
DMS data.
