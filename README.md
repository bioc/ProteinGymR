## Data resources from ProteinGym

The `ProteinGymR` package provides analysis-ready data resources from [ProteinGym](ProteinGym.org), generated by Notin et al. [2023](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10723403/). ProteinGym is a collection of benchmarks useful for comparing the ability of different variant prediction models. Currently, this package two datasets


The benchmarks in ProteinGym are divided according to mutation type (substitutions vs. indels), ground truth source (DMS assay vs. clinical annotation), and training regime (zero-shot vs. supervised).
