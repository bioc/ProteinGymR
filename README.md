# ProteinGymR

## Data resources from ProteinGym

The `ProteinGymR` package provides analysis-ready data resources from
[ProteinGym](ProteinGym.org), generated by Notin et al.
[2023](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10723403/). ProteinGym 
comprises a collection of benchmarks for evaluating the performance of multiple 
variant prediction tools. Currently, this package provides access to two 
datasets: 1. Deep mutational scanning (DMS) scores generated from single 
substitution mutations across 216 assays and 2. predicted AlphaMissense 
pathogenicity scores for ~1.6M substitutions matching those in the ProteinGym 
DMS data.
